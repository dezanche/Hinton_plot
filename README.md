# Hinton_plot
The function Hinton_plot.m works in Matlab or Octave to display a real or complex matrix using a Hinton diagram.
The advantages of Hinton diagrams over traditional color-mapped display (e.g., imagesc) are:
- differences in magnitude of the matrix elements are more readily captured by the size of the markers as opposed to colour or grayscale differences
- if complex the phase is also visualized (as a colour), which is impossible with traditional display
Examples are shown below for 8-dimensional correlation and covariance matrices.
